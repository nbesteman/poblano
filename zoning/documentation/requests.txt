Good morning, gentlemen,
Attached is an amendment that was made to the Hopkins Village Zoning Map.  Just trying to keep you in the loop- not sure if it’s helpful or not?
Also, I know you guys have been slammed… just checking on progress for the updated version of the Salem Township Zoning Map.  
Thanks, and have a great day!
